# ðŸ’³ Prediction of Credit Card Default using Machine Learning Algorithms

The goal of this notebook is to accurately predict if a customer is likely to default, and discover which variables are good predictors of possible default.
As part of an academic project, I wrote a paper explaining the methods used and explaining the findings.

## Machine Learning methods used:

- KNN
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
